## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.9 or Higher**: Essential for running the Python-based application.
- **pip**: The Python package installer, used for managing Python packages.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies for your project. This ensures that your project's dependencies are kept separate from your system-wide Python packages.

#### 1. Install virtualenv

If you haven't installed `virtualenv` yet, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

#### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment named `venv`:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

#### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On Unix or MacOS:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

You should see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your command line prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

#### 4. Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

With your virtual environment set up and dependencies installed, you're ready to run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```
